## Explain as muxh as you know about objects in javascript?

Objecta in javascript are one of the core concepts that enables the language's flexibility and power. objects provide a way to organise and structure data and functionality in a cohesive unit.

Objects can be created using different methods like 
* Object Literal: using curly braces **'{}'**

* Constructor Function: Using a function as a constructor to create objects.

* class Syntax: Introduced in ES6, providing a more structured way to define object blueprints.

* Object.create(): Creating a new object based on an existing object as its prototype.

### Accessing Object properties:

Properties of an object can be accessed using dot notation (object.property) or square bracket notation (object[property]).

Properties can be added or deleted from an object at runtime. You can use the 'delete' keyword to remove a property from an object.

Javascript has a range of built-in objects, like 'Array', 'String', 'Number', 'Date', etc., that provide specific functionalities beyond what reqular object offer.
