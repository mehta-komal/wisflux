## What is NodeJS?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows running Javascript code on the server, enabling the development of scalable and efficient network applications.
 
## What is V8 Engine?
The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It powers many modern web browsers and is also used by Node.js. It compiles javascript into machine code, optimizing its execution speed.

## What is Event Loop in NodeJS?

## What is JSON format?
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format. It's a text-based format that represents structured data as key-value pairs. JSON is easy for both humans and machines to read and write.


## Why we use JSON format for API?
JSON is commonly used as the data format for APIs because of its simplicity and easy of use. It's language-agnostic, making it suitable for various programming languages. JSON's lightweight nature reduces data overhead during communication.

## What is Framework?
A framework is a pre-built set of tools.libraries, and conventions that simplifies the process of building applications. It provides a structured way to develop and organize code, reducing the need to start from scratch.

## How an HTTP Communication works.
HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocols) is the foundation of data communication on the internet. It involves requests sent by clients (such as browsers) to servers, and responses sent by servers back to clients.

## What is Middleware in ExpressJS?
Middleware in express.js are functions that execute between the request and response phases of an HTTP request. They can modify the request and response objects, perform tasks, and control the flow of the application.
